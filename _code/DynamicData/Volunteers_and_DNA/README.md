# Volunteers and DNA

The [Volunteers and DNA](https://rock.vrl.church/page/1921) Page was born out of a very specific need. I would not be surprised if this becomes obsolete in a year or two; but I would also not be surprised if this becomes a permanent fixture in VRL's Rock instance.

In either case, I thought it'd be a good idea to keep a version history and documentation of the Lava and SQL that power this Dynamic Data Block.
