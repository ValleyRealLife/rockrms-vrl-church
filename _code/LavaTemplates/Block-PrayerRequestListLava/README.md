# Prayer Request List Lava
This is a very minor change.

When I first arrived at VRL, the Prayer Request List in our Dashboards had an unordered list of all prayers assigned to CurrentPerson.<br>
The downside was that each line item said, "Assigned to Current.Person". And this wasn't super hepful.<br>
So we changed a line in the Lava Template in order to go from this:<br>

to this:<br>
