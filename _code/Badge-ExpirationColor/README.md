## About
Currently, most of the Badges in our Rock instance are for the [Person] Entity. Therefore, the 'Type' column in the <a href="https://rock.vrl.church/admin/general/badges">Badge List</a> will say "Person". i only make note of this because i foresee VRL might find it useful to create some badges for the [Group] and [GroupMember] Entities too.

The [idea.lava](./idea.lava) is where i keep a general idea of a template.

## Index
That being said, here's a description of the Lava Badges that i created or modified thus far:
| Badge Name | Lava File | Description |
