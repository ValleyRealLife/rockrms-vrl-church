# Workflow Actions
This Directory may or may not become archived.

When i first started this GitHub repo, i was using this directory in order to keep version-control on Lava that i would use within WorkflowTypes; back then, i thought it made sense to create a folder per WorkflowActionType.

More-reently, i created a Directory labeled [WorkflowTypes](../WorkflowTypes/README.md) and i think that **that** Directory has a better way of meeting my version-control needs.
