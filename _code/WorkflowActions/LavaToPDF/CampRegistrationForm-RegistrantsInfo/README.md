# Camp Registrants Info
i made this folder to contain any Lava that we write in order to generate Registrant info.  
At the very least, i foresee this being necessary for generating (1) a MAR chart for student medication that the Camp Nurse will take in her binder, and (2) a roster for each student that is going to the camp; it might be useful for roll-call inside each bus.

## Camp Registrants Medical Info (MAR Chart)
This is the first implementation of this idea.  
Currently, the NextGen Administrative Assistant (and/or the corresponding Camp Nurse) is painstakingly (and manually) writing down each medication for each student in a blank MAR chart template that they print. By making Rock generate this for them, we will be saving a lot of time and effort.
