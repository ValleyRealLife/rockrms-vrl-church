# VRL Internal Recipes

Tim re-created the Recipes page from the Rock Community Site for the sake of enabling/empowering our staff members to share SOPs, tips/tricks, and other such informational demonstration.

This consists of three pages:
1. A Page that contains three blocks:
   1. [HTML Content] Block to show a button that says "Add Recipe"
   2. [Page Parameter Filter] Block that allows users to filter recipes by ContentChannelItem Attributes
   3. [Content Channel View] Block that shows the actual Content Channel Items
2. A sub-page that contains one block:
   1. [Content Channel View] Block that will be used for creating new Recipes or editing existing ones
3. A sub-page that contains one block:
   1. [HTML Content] Block to show the content of the Content Channel Item to the user who wants to simply read.

This current directory contains the Lava used in the [HTML Content] Block configured in the third page.

Refer to [this directory](../../Block-ContentChannelView/VRL_Internal_Recipes/) to find the Lava used in the [Content Channal View] Block configured in the first page.
