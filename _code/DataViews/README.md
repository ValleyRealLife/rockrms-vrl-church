# DataViews using Sql Query
The Rock Shop has a package named **Data Toolkit** (PackageId=73, Published by Blue Box Moon). This plugin allows us to use SQL for Data Views.

i am still following Kjell's advise to use SQL only as a last-resort. But when it's clearly the best option (or the only option), i will create a DataView that uses a Sql Query, and i will start documenting some of those queries in this directory.
