# An Overview of DataViews
In PageId:145, we have a Tree with all our DataViews.

When selecting a "folder", the URL gets appended with `CategoryId`

There is now a **Dynamic Data** Block that references that `CategoryId` in order to show an overview of the DataViews contained within that folder.

This Block was borne out of a need/desire of auditing the 'Temporary Views' folder and deleting unnecessary/obsolete DataViews.
