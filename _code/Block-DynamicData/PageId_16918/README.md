# DynamicData Blocks in Page 16918

These **Dynamic Data** Blocks are found in [Audit Check-in for KidsCamp](../../Block-HTMLContent/PageId_16918/README.md).
(Please note that there is some JavaScript that "moves" these Blocks to be "inside" another section, for the sake of visual clarity)

## Audit PersonId between RegistrationRegistrant and GroupMember
One of the technicalities about KidsCamp is that __registering__ for the event is not the same as __being able to check-in__ to the event.

In order to make that audit easier, this **Dynamic Data** Block visualizes the cross-section between
(1) Persons who have been registered into an event, and
(2) Persons who have been added to the corresponding Check-in Group

## Query Attendance
This Block aims to make it easier to get a glance of attendance per camp.
