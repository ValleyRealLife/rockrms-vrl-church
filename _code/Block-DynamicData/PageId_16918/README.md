# Audit PersonId between RegistrationRegistrant and GroupMember

This **Dynamic Data** Block is found in [Audit Check-in for KidsCamp](../../Block-HTMLContent/PageId_16918/README.md).
(Please note that there is some JavaScript that "moves" this Block to be "inside" another section, for the sake of visual clarity)

One of the technicalities about KidsCamp is that __registering__ for the event is not the same as __being able to check-in__ to the event.

In order to make that audit easier, this **Dynamic Data** Block visualizes the cross-section between
(1) Persons who have been registered into an event, and
(2) Persons who have been added to the corresponding Check-in Group
