# New GroupMembers in DateRange
This DynamicData Block (found in PageId:3794) shows a Grid with the GroupMembers that have been added in the DateRange specified by the user.

Therefore, this DynamicData Block necessitates a PageParameterFilter Block that allows the user to input a SlidingDateRange attribute, with Key='DateRange'

It's also worth noting that the Lava+SQL in this DynamicData Block is identical to the Lava+SQL in DataViewId:907
