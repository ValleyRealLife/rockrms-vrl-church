# Use Lava to inject CSS
i have only used this a handful of times, and it was only for injecting a "display: none;" for HTML content that i want to hide from non-developers, but i can see how this idea has potential to be used for a variety of situations.

## Concept / Example:
- Use Lava for an IF statement that checks whether CurrentPerson.Id is Tim Seo
- IF true, proceed; ELSE, inject "display: none;" either as internal CSS or in-line CSS

## Potential improvements:
- This concept could be applied for checking whether CurrentPerson.Id exists in some group, rather than check for an individual person.
