# SQL for Pledge Giving
i haven't quite wrapped my mind around this yet, but i know just enough to do what i need to do and move on.

i'm writing this down in order to be able to come back to this.

1. [This first SQL query](./EveryPersonThatGave.sql) shows a row for each Person that gave,
2. [This second SQL query](./SpousesOfPersonsThatGave.sql) shows a row for each Person that is a spouse of a Person in the first SQL query,
3. [This third SQL query]() is using the `UNION` operator in order to show in one result set the results from the above two SQL queries (i removed all columns except the [Id] because i needed to use this SQL in a DataView).
