# Front-End Button that Triggers/Instantiates a Workflow
i came across needing to create a button for triggering/instantiating workflows a few times in the past two years. i never documented it and i always googled it.

- JavaScript popup window
  - [BlockId:4323](./BlockId4323.lava)
- Modal
  - [BlockId:6357](../../Block-DynamicData/Report_LifeGroups-PageId_4798/BlockId_6357-FormattedOutput.lava)
    - (Search for the `GenerateUrlWithCorrectParams` function)
