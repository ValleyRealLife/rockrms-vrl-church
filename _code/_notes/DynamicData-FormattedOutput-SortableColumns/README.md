When using DynamicData blocks, as soon as i touch the **Formatted Output** setting, i don't get to avail of Rock's default settings for sortable columns and pagination.

Therefore, if i want the formatted output to look like a table, then i am responsible for baking-in those QOL features.

One way to achieve this is by implementing the [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) library.
