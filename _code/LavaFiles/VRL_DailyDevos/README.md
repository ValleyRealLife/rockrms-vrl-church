# VRL DailyDevotional
Tim created this Folder on 26-FEB-2025 in order to pull together any LavaFile that might be used with the intent of being referenced in various places via the `{% include %}` keyword.

Currently, there is only one file here, and its FileName matches the FileName in the VRL Server Filesystem (Reference: ~~/Assets/Lava/VRL24_DailyDevotional.lava)

The reason why i named it with `VRL24` is simply because that was the naming convention that existed with other Files in that location.
