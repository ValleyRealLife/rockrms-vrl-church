Sign-Up is a feature new to VRL as of Rock v15

BlockTypes related to Sign-Up is also the first time VRL is introduced to Id Hash.

A very small inconvenience is that we dont have access to the `FromIdHash` Filter until v16. ([Reference](https://community.rockrms.com/lava/filters/other-filters#fromidhash))
