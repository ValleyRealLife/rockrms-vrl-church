# Group Change Log
Jeremy wanted to abstract [Group History](https://rock.vrl.church/page/565?GroupId=44037) one level, such that he didn't have to navigate Group by Group and click th "History" button in order to view all the changes in all the Life Groups.

Rather, he wanted to be able to enter a Date Range, and have an eagle-eye view of all the Groups that had been created/modified/archived in that timeframe.

(i still made it such that they could click into any of these groups and view the Group History block via a modal with an iframe)
