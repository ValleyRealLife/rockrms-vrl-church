# Medical Info for Camp Registrants

This HTML Content Block renders the 'Health' page from the Person Profile of all Persons who are associated with a Registrant who is registered in some Registration Instance. (Therefore, this Page also contains a **Page Parameter Filter** Block that enables the user to set the 'RegInsId' Page Parameter)

This HTML Content Block essentially takes the 'RegInsId' Page Parameter, and passes it as the 'reginsid' parameter of the [HealthChartForCampNurse](../../ShortCodes/ShortCodeId_62/README.md) Short Code.
