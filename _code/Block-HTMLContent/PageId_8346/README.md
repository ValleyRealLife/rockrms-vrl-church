# NextStepForm for existing VRL attendees

There will be a page that acts as a "home screen" for the iPads at our church lobby. That page will show two buttons:
1. I am new to VRL
2. I am not new to VRL

The former will lead them to a "New Guest" connect card; whereas the latter will lead them to this Page 8346.

The goal of this Page 8346 is to make it easy+simple for people to take their immediate next step, whatever that might be.

Page 8346 currently has two **HTML Content** Blocks:
1. [BlockId=8498](./BlockId_8498.lava) is the Block that contains the main UI elements
2. [BlockId=8497](./BlockId_8497.lava) is for utility
