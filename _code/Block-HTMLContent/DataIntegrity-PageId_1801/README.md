# HomePage for Data Integrity Volunteers
Star > Data Ministry > [Data Integrity](https://rock.vrl.church/page/1801) [PageId=1801] is a Page that Tim created in order to contain in one place all the things that our Data Integrity Volunteers are asked to maintain. Currently, it has two *HTML Content* Blocks:
1. Sidebar1 Zone - Data Integrity Welcome Info [BlockId=5396]
2. Main Zone - Data Integrity ChildPages [BlockId=4695]

## Data Integrity Welcome Info [BlockId=5396]
This is a block that contains a "presence" indicator, and an accordion for various tidbits of information that might be helpful to the Data Integrity volunteers.

## Data Integrity ChildPages [BlockId=4695]
This is just a block that links to the Child Pages. The reason why i didn't use the **Page Menu** Block instead is because i wanted to have the option of using Lava in order to show a badge-pill that shows the number of records that you could find inside each child page.
