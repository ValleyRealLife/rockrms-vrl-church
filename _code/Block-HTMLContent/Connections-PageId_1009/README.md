# Connection Opportunity Info

People > Connections > [Connection Board](https://rock.vrl.church/page/1009) has various **HTML Content** Blocks in the 'Feature' Zone. 

The idea is that each of these *HTML Content* Blocks begin by checking the `ConnectionOpportunityId` Parameter in the URL, and only show if appropriate. (This is probably not best-practice for scalability, but if we're only doing this for a handful of Connection Opportunities, this approach should be fine).
