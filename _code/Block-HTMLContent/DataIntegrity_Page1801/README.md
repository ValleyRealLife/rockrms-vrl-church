# Data Integrity ChildPages

Star > Data Ministry > [Data Integrity](https://rock.vrl.church/page/1801) has an **HTML Content** Block in the 'Main' Zone.

This is just a block that links to the Child Pages. The reason why i didn't use the **Page Menu** Block instead is because i wanted to have the option of using Lava in order to show a badge-pill that shows the number of records that you could find inside each child page.
