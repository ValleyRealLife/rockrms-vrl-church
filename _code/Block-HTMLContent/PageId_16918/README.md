# The Main HTML Block in the "Audit Check-in for KidsCamp" Page

The HTML in this Block relies heavily on the existence of a `RegInsId` value among the URL parameters.

Therefore, this Page also contains a **Page Parameter Filter** Block [Id: 12949] that will ensure that the User has selected a RegInsId.

This Page was designed in order to make it easier to audit the Check-in system for KidsCamp.

This **HTML Content** Block seeks to be a step-by-step guide, a FAQ, and an action center all in one.
