# GroupToolbox: Utility for LG Coaches

Page 1128 is the External Page that has our Group Toolbox.

This Group Toolbox, by default, is used for LifeGroup Leaders and Co-Leaders to be able to manage their groups.

Jeremy Anglin needed the LifeGroup Coaches to be able to have similar usability.

Instead of categorizing the 'Coach' Role as a "Leader", we wrote some custom Lava and created a custom WorkflowType because the needs were different enough to warrant some custom development.
