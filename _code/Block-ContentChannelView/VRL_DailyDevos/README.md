# VRL Daily Devo via SMS
The vision is that our subscribers would receive a URL via SMS, they click on it to read today's daily devotional.

Logistically, serving "today's daily devotional" will be a ContentChannel with some attributes.

Lastly, since most of our staff members are not familiar with creating ContentChannelItems, we will configure a WorkflowType that will serve a Form for staff to enter these devotional content.
