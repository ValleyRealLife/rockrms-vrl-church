# Hello World üëã
This repository was created in order to contain all the things about VRL's Rock implementation that could be shared externally and collaborated on.

i like the idea of [CodeTour](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/educators/codetour), this is a VSC Extension that will allow the code author to give you a "tour" of their code. Essentially, it's like adding comments to your code, but differently. i will try to get in the habit of creating CodeTours for codes that could be confusing without context/explanation. ([VSC Marketplace: CodeTour Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour))

<br>

# How to Use this Repository
1. The [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) is recommended.
2. The [CodeTour](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour) Extension is recommended.
3. Inside the `_code` Folder,
   1. the Folders where the name begins with an underline (e.g. the `_attachments` Folder) is akin to footnotes or margin-notes.
   2. the other Folders try to denote an Entity or Context where the code snippet is used.
      - For the sake of making it easier to navigate in GitHub, each Folder should have its own README.
      - Each Lava file should start with a comment block that denotes where this snippet is being used. See 'Lava Header Examples' below.

# Lava Header Examples
It used to be that i would have an example boilerplate for the files in this GitHub repo, and a separate example boilerplate for files you'd find in Rock.

Now, it's the same boilerplate regardless of whether it's a file here in this GitHub repo or in Rock.

The only discretion necessary is whether you'd use the multi-line [Lava comment syntax](https://community.rockrms.com/lava/tags/comment-tags), or whether you'd use the multi-line commment syntax of some other language. i say default to using the Lava comment syntax, but if you're in a context where it's safer to use the comment syntax of another language, simply use the syntax of the language that won't cause trouble. ü´°

## Examples
```
/---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This Lava is found in
    PageId=1128, BLockId=6222, [Block.Name] > [Block.ConfigurationSection] > Block.ConfigurationField
    
    This Lava is used to mimic the Group List Personalized Lava Block type. However, rather than showing a list of Groups where CurrentPerson is the Leader, it shows a list of Groups where CurrentPerson is the Coach.
    This Lava requires the 'Sql' Lava commands enabled.
    
    Path:
    _code/Block-HTMLContent/CoachingGroups_PageId1128/BlockId6222-ListOfCoachingGroups.lava
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/
```

If the Lava file was created by copy+pasting an existing Lava Template (maybe it was written by SparkDev or Triumph in core Rock), then please make note of it like this:
```
/---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This Lava is found in
    PageId=1128, BLockId=6222, [Block.Name] > [Block.ConfigurationSection] > Block.ConfigurationField
    
    i am copy+pasting this here from the VRL Rock Site.
    i copy+pasted this on 09-APR-2024

# Some Formatting Standards
VRL doesn't have a strong "formatting guideline" yet, but i'm trying to standardize some things as i go.

With any programming language that we use, indentation is 4-spaces.

## 1. SQL
Mostly following [Rock Community's SQL Style Guide](https://community.rockrms.com/developer/sql-style-guide), except for a few changes and/or considerations:
<details open><summary>When listing Table Columns, align the Table Alias, not the comma</summary>

‚úÖ Yes:
```sql
SELECT
    g.[Id]
  , g.[Name]
  , g.[Description]
  , g.[Guid]
FROM
    [Group] g
WHERE
    g.[Id] = 1
;
```
‚ùå No:
```sql
SELECT
    g.[Id]
    , g.[Name]
    , g.[Description]
    , g.[Guid]
FROM
    [Group] g
WHERE
    g.[Id] = 1
;

```
</details>

<details><summary>When concatenating, use <code>CONCAT()</code>, please do not use the <code>+</code> operator</summary>

‚úÖ Yes:
```sql
SELECT
    g.[Id]
  , CONCAT(g.[Name], ' Group')
  , g.[Guid]
FROM
    [Group] g
WHERE
    g.[Id] = 1
;
```
‚ùå No:
```sql
SELECT
    g.[Id]
  , g.[Name] + ' Group'
  , g.[Guid]
FROM
    [Group] g
WHERE
    g.[Id] = 1
;
```
</details>

<details><summary>When aliasing Columns, use single-quotes rather than square brackets</summary>
(it helps my syntax-highlighting to be more readable on VSC and ADS)

‚úÖ Yes:
```sql
SELECT
    p.[Id]
  , CONCAT(p.[NickName], ' ', p.[LastName]) AS 'Person Name'
  , p.[AgeClassification]
FROM
    [Person] p
WHERE
    p.[Id] = 1
;
```
‚ùå No:
```sql
SELECT
    p.[Id]
  , CONCAT(p.[NickName], ' ', p.[LastName]) AS [Person Name]
  , p.[AgeClassification]
FROM
    [Person] p
WHERE
    p.[Id] = 1
;
```
</details>

<details><summary>When joining Tables, keep the <code>JOIN</code> and <code>ON</code> keywords in the same line</summary>

‚úÖ Yes:
```sql
SELECT
    gm.[Id]
FROM
    [GroupMember] gm
    LEFT JOIN [Person] p ON p.[Id] = gm.[PersonId]
    LEFT JOIN [PersonAlias] pa ON pa.[Id] = gm.[CreatedByPersonAliasId]
WHERE
    gm.[GroupId] = 1
;
```
‚ùå No:
```sql
SELECT
    gm.[Id]
FROM
    [GroupMember] gm
    LEFT JOIN [Person] p
    ON p[Id] = gm.[PersonId]
    LEFT JOIN [PersonAlias] pa
    ON pa.[Id] = gm.[CreatedByPersonAliasId]
WHERE
    gm.[GroupId] = 1
;
```
‚ùå No:
```sql
SELECT
    gm.[Id]
FROM
    [GroupMember] gm
LEFT JOIN
    [Person] p
    ON p.[Id] = gm.[PersonId]
LEFT JOIN
    [PersonAlias] pa
    ON pa.[Id] = gm.[CreatedByPersonAliasId]
WHERE
    gm.[GroupId] = 1
;
```
</details>

<details><summary>On that same note, if the <code>JOIN</code> <code>ON</code> needs an <code>AND</code>, also keep that in the same line</summary>

‚úÖ Yes:
```sql
SELECT
    gm.[Id]
FROM
    [GroupMember] gm
    LEFT JOIN [PersonAlias] pa1 ON pa1.[Id] = gm.[CreatedByPersonAliasId] AND pa1.[PersonId] = pa1.[AliasPersonId]
    LEFT JOIN [PersonAlias] pa2 ON pa2.[Id] = gm.[ModifiedByPersonAliasId] AND pa2.[PersonId] = pa2.[AliasPersonId]
WHERE
    gm.[GroupId] = 1
;
```
‚ùå No:
```sql
SELECT
    gm.[Id]
FROM
    [GroupMember] gm
    LEFT JOIN [PersonAlias] pa1 ON pa1.[Id] = gm.[CreatedByPersonAliasId]
    AND pa1.[PersonId] = pa1.[AliasPersonId]
    LEFT JOIN [PersonAlias] pa2 ON pa2.[Id] = gm.[ModifiedByPersonAliasId]
    AND pa2.[PersonId] = pa2.[AliasPersonId]
WHERE
    gm.[GroupId] = 1
;
```
</details>

## 2. Lava
Mostly following [Rock Community's Lava Style Guide](https://community.rockrms.com/lava/style), except for a few changes and/or considerations:
<details open><summary>Prepend your Lava variables with a three-character abbreviation of its expected data type</summary>
i want to teach my volunteers that "variables defined by Tim" will be prepended, whereas "variables defined by Spark" will not.

Example:
```
    {% assign var_PersonId = CurrentPerson.Id %}
    {% assign obj_Person = var_PersonId | PersonById %}
```
In the example above, i could teach them that `CurrentPerson` has been defined by Spark, whereas `var_PersonId` and `obj_Person` are variables that i defined for this piece of code.

Most of the times, i just prepend with `var_` because i'm lazy. Sometimes i prepend with the data type in hopes that it'll help the future reader.
</details>

### Lava Tags and Commands:
i haven't quite landed on a standard for indenting Tags (especially when mixed with HTML), so this is what i've got thus far:
<details open><summary>Unless the blank space affects the output, use blank spaces for indenting the content between the opening and closing Tags.</summary>

- Blank space does not affect `{% if %}{% endif %}`,
```
{% if var_PersonId != empty %}
    do the thing
{% else %}
    don't do the thing
{% endif %}
```
- but it affects `{% capture %}{% endcapture %}`
```
{% capture var_Something %}
capture this string right here
{% endcapture %}
```
</details>

### HTML with Lava FOR loops
<details open><summary>When using <code>{% for %}</code> to create list items, follow this indentation pattern:</summary>

Notice there is no indentation between `{% for %}` and `<li>` because that would essentially be two indentations between `<ul>` and `<li>`
```html
<ul>
    {% for var_Group in array_Groups %}
    <li class="list-group-item">
        {{ var_Group.Name }}
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
```
</details>

## 3. Workflow Types
When configuring WorkflowTypes, i have some conventions i'd like to follow:
1. As a rule of thumb, most WorkflowTypes should have at least two Activities: one named "START" and one named "FINISH"
   - "START" is the Activity that sets any Attributes that are needed for the execution of this WorkflowType,
   - "FINISH" is the Activity that contains the 'Complete Workflow' Action.
   - Every other Activity can be named with normal capitalization, no need for all-caps.
1. Every Action should be named with a verb at the beginning. Example:
   - Activate Activity
   - Set Person Attributes
   - Complete Workflow
   - etc
1. When the name of an Action contains the name of an Activity, use square-brackets. Example:
   - Activate [FINISH]
   - Activate [Loop]
   - etc
1. When the name of an Action contains the Key (not Name) of a Workflow Attribute or Activity Attribute, use parentheses. Example:
   - Set (var_Person) from CurrentPerson
   - Send SMS to (var_Person) with (memo_Message)
   - Add Note to (obj_Person_Submitter)
   - etc
1. When naming a WorkflowType, it's (v1.0)
   - Modifying the WorkflowType doesn't necessarily increment the version label if it's a small change.
   - If it's a big change, it increments the version dot (from v1.0 to v1.1) and add a Note to the ChangeLog.
   - If it's a change so big that it cannot be done by modifying the WorkflowType, and rather we must create a new WorkflowType that replaces this one, then the new WorkflowType gets a new version number (v2.0) and the previous WorkflowType gets archived.
